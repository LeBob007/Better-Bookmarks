'test_titles' contains a script to test our model trained on desc input
on title input.

Results were poor demonstrating the need to train a model specifically on title
inputs if that's the only data available to make predictions.

In other words we will use a model trained on desc if we have desc data available
from the desired html, else we will use title data from the html on a model trained
with titles.

'misc_tests' contains other attempts at improving our models.

'best_desc' and 'best_title' contain the scripts for training the most accurate desc and
title models along with saved results.
