'test_titles' contains a script to test our model trained on desc input
on title input.

Results were poor demonstrating we need to train a model specifically on title
inputs if that's the only data we have to make predictions.

In other words we will use a model trained on desc if we have desc data available
from the desired html, else we will use title data from the html on a model trained
with titles.
