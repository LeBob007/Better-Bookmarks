Python scripts for data preparation of dmoz.csv and url.csv.

NOTE: I renamed 'URL Classification.csv' to 'url.csv' on my local machine.
      Also, 'dmoz.csv' and 'url.csv' are too big to be uploaded to git. If you want
      to run a script(s) download the source data and desired script(s) to run locally.
